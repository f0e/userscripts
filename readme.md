# userscripts

My userscripts. I currently use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), so other userscript managers might have issues.

To install a script, click on its header.

### [Display hidden bandcamp tracks](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/hidden-bandcamp-tracks.user.js)

Ported from [7x11x13's hidden bandcamp tracks extension](https://github.com/7x11x13/hidden-bandcamp-tracks), all credit goes to them.

### [Profile picture dates](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/profile-picture-dates.user.js)

Adds dates to profile pictures on certain websites which retain accurate `last-modified` headers. Lets you know when users uploaded their profile picture.

### [Enable StackOverflow themes](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/enable-stackoverflow-themes.user.js)

Enables StackOverflow's theming which typically only works when logged in. Sets dark/light mode based on your system preferences.

### [Random steam group](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/random-steam-group.user.js)

Adds a button onto steam groups which takes you to another random steam group.

### [RateYourMusic+](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/rateyourmusic+.user.js)

Adds additional functionality to RateYourMusic.

##### Top tracks finder (subscriber only)

The top tracks finder adds buttons on artist profiles and charts which fetch the highest rated tracks on releases. This does not include singles, as you can already sort by rating for those. This lets you easily find the best songs by an artist or in any chart.

It also caches track ratings for every release page you view (only used to avoid re-requesting pages currently, but could be used in the future to show old track ratings if you stop subscribing).

Please do not abuse this feature, you will most likely be banned from the site. Sonemic does not like scraping.

### [Steam Groups+](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/steam-groups+.user.js)

Adds the group clantag, creation date and if the current account is the owner on the /groups page of any Steam profile.

### [Steam Profile Info](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/steam-profile-info.user.js)

Adds text on Steam user profiles displaying the date of their last username change, and adds an alert if they're shadow trade banned.
