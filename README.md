# userscripts

My userscripts. I currently use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), so other userscript managers might have issues.

To install a script, click on its header.

### [Display hidden bandcamp tracks](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/hidden-bandcamp-tracks.user.js)

Ported from [7x11x13's hidden bandcamp tracks extension](https://github.com/7x11x13/hidden-bandcamp-tracks), all credit goes to them.

### [Profile picture dates](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/profile-picture-dates.user.js)

Adds dates to profile pictures on certain websites which retain accurate `last-modified` headers. Lets you know when users uploaded their profile picture.

### [Enable StackOverflow themes](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/enable-stackoverflow-themes.user.js)

Enables StackOverflow's theming which typically only works when logged in. Sets dark/light mode based on your system preferences.

### [Random steam group](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/random-steam-group.user.js)

Adds a button onto steam groups which takes you to another random steam group.

### [Steam Groups+](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/steam-groups+.user.js)

Adds the group clantag, creation date and if the current account is the owner on the /groups page of any Steam profile.

### [Steam Profile Info](https://github.com/f0e/userscripts/raw/main/steam-profile-info.user.js)

Adds text on Steam user profiles displaying the date of their last username change, and adds an alert if they're shadow trade banned.
